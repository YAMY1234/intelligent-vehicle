# Product introduction

Metro operation cost is high, bus travel speed is slow, urban traffic "pain points" how to solve?

The smart train transportation system demonstration line officially opened on Jiading Huyi Highway recently gives a new solution. The solution uses cutting-edge technologies such as intelligent network connection, Big data, and artificial intelligence to "butterfly" traditional urban public transportation resources into a new generation of medium and large-volume urban backbone transportation systems, integrating the flexibility of highway transportation with the advantages of large-volume rail transportation, which will be safer, more comfortable, efficient and environmentally friendly.

At the same time, the sign directly above the bus lane of Huyi Highway shows that during the two peak periods of 7:00-10:00 and 16:00-19:00, vehicles that can pass on the bus lane, in addition to buses, vehicles with two or more occupants can pass.

The smart train will be tested on the Shanghai-Yi Highway from 9:50-10:50 and 15:00-16:00 using multi-occupant lanes. After the test is completed, the operating time will be adjusted to provide travel services for the public. The smart train transportation system is planned by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, with collaborative innovation by scientific research forces from Tongji University, Tsinghua University, Hunan University and High Tech, and industrial development and application by Dexin Smart Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
